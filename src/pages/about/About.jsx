                                Hi! My name is Adam.
                                <span>&#128075;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm a recently graduated mechanical engineering student from
                                University of Waterloo, Canada. I am a self-taught programmer with
                                a passion for learning and expanding my skillset. My goal is to
                                build sustainable and applicable products that push the limits of
                                technology and design. At the moment I am most interested learning 
                                and building things in robotics, entrepreneurship, and automation.
                            </p>

                                Most recently, I was working as a Software Developer at a start-up
                                called {JuniorAILink} that was focused on integrating machine learning
                                into the legal and documentation industry.

                                    Aside from school and work, I enjoy having fun with my close
                                    friends and family, reading, and learning about new things. 
                                    I am oftentimes reading a sci-fi or fantasy novel, but I make 
                                    sure to mix in a science or business book too. I am currently 
                                    reading{' '}<span className="italics">Never Split the Differece by Chris Voss</span>,
                                    which is a handbook of negotating principles culled from Chris\
                                    Voss's career has both hostage negotiator and business teacher.

                                    I tend to stay active with a variety of different activities 
                                    like rock-climbing or basketball, but right now am most invested
                                    with weight-lifting.

                                    I am consistently tinkering with this website and adding new
                                    features or updating it with what's new in my life, so keep an eye out!
